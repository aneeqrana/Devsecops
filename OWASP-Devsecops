Fundamentals of OWASP Devsecops (DSOM) Maturity Model

OWASP DSOM is a framework developed to show application security measures which can be applied using Devsecops.

It has 4 Levels (Level 1 - Least to Level 4 - Fully implemented )

Level 1 - Basic Understandings of Security practices

Level 2 - Adoption of basic Security practices

Level 3 - High Adoption of security practices 

Level 4 - Advanced adoption of security practices


Matrix 
Dimension 
- Build and Deployment
- Culture and Organization
- Implementation
- Information Gathering 
- test Verification

Sub-dimension
- Each dimension is made up of subdimensions, eg. The implementation dimension is comprised of infrastructure hardening and application hardening. 

Test and verification Dimension
Static Depth: How comprehensive/deep the static code scan executed within the CI pipeline 
Dynamic Depth: How comprehensive/deep the dynamic scans executed within the CI pipeline
Intensity: How frequent are the security scans running in CI pipelines 
Consolidation: How complete is the process of handling findings in the CI pipeline


Sub Dimension Static Depth

Level 1 - Basic Understandings of Security practices
test of server side components with known vulneribilites
Level 2 - Adoption of basic Security practices
Static analysis for important server side componenets 
Level 3 - High Adoption of security practices 
Static analysis of important clinet side componenets 
test of client side components with known vulneribilities 
Level 4 - Advanced adoption of security practices
Exclusion of source code duplicates 
static analysis for all components/libraries
static analysis for all self written components 
styllic analysis 
Usage of multiple analyzers 




Sub Dimension Dynamic Depth
Level 1 - Basic Understandings of Security practices
Simple scan
Level 2 - Adoption of basic Security practices
Coverage client side dynamic components
Usage of different roles 
Level 3 - High Adoption of security practices 
Coverage of hidden endpoints 
coverage of more input vectors 
coverage of sequential operations 
usage of multiple scanners
Level 4 - Advanced adoption of security practices
Coverage analysis 
Coverage of service to service communication



Dimension Culture and Organization
Level 1 - Basic Understandings of Security practices
Conduction of Simple threat modeling on technical level 
Level 2 - Adoption of basic Security practices
Conduction of Simple threat modeling on business level 
Creation of simple abuse stories 
Level 3 - High Adoption of security practices 
Conduction of advanced threat modeling 
Level 4 - Advanced adoption of security practices
Creation of advanced abuse stories
