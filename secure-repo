Uploaded linux/Unix home directories with sensitive dot files 
~/.ssh directories with keys


Best Practices
Strong Access Controls 
Implement Least privilege
Use 2FA by everyone Associated with the repo

Protect the credentials 
Seperarte Secret creds from source code.
Use ignore files to prevent the sensitive information to be pushed.
Use Secret management softwares 
Never store creds as code/config in github

Never Commit sensitive information 
Implement pre commit hook.

Review all code changes 
Keep git related tools up to date 

Sign your work
Implement signed commits and tags into workflows. 




We can scan our git repo for credentials to see if we have any sensitive information shared on the repo. 
Use the tools like 
Gittyleaks
Gitsecrets
Repo Supervisor
